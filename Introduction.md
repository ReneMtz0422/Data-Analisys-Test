# Introduction

In this repository my purpose is to document the way i can answer the questions my superiors do to me about the way we use the resources about materials.
For context i work on a Building/Arquitecture oriented company, In a project we buy the material to install in a project so we usually first buy the materials and during the instalation of this material we make files called estimates that we send to the client
This file describes what we have installed on the project so we know what we should charge to the client.
