# Problem description 

Now that we know a little introduction of how the company manages tha material in a project we can talk about the principal issue that this represents.
The firs thint that this way to work is that the only control of material that the company uses is a software called "MasAdmin" where the only thing you can do is to make the exits of materials and you can load the
purchase orders of the material.
We have a list of the principal issues about this like :

-We didn´t have any source of information to know how much we are spending on materials for a project and how much we are charging to the client.

-On "MasAdmin" we dont have any way to recopilate information, the only thing we can do is to expropiate the purchase orders on a pdf file and it´s the only way we can extract the information

-To know how much we are charging on every material we need to work together with the estimating department

-We need a Database (In this case we use excel what i will explain it later how we work on it) 


Next Step is the Extraction

-[Extraction](Extract.md)
