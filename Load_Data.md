   # Loading The Data
   
Now that already i have the dataset´s ready it´s time to start working on Power BI, in first instance we open a new power BI file

I load the Data in the home tab from power bi i select the function "Obtain data" 

![obtener data](https://github.com/ReneMtz0422/Data-Analysis-Test/assets/158523436/9fad71b8-9602-496c-92b8-b3d4f4180b70)

We should use the "Excel book" option

![excel book](https://github.com/ReneMtz0422/Data-Analysis-Test/assets/158523436/f89e1a79-7e71-4177-8c3a-828965e53716)

Then i select the Excel file that we start working on the first instance of the project.

Once the dataset is charged on PowerBI we check all the information is charged whithout errors.

We move to the "View table" tab

And we check that the data is correct. This is what we should see, And you should check the tables and columns on the data tab at the right
