For this phase i first need to know the project number to filter from "MasAdmin" Software and get all the purchase orders in pdf

      Note: In the example i am not using any sensitive information cause of privacy policies
    

Once I got all the purchase orders i have to load all the information in an excel format

2.- Illustrative Example of the excel database used

    Note: The values on the columns Cant,M.N.Prec, M.N.IVA, M.N.Subtotal and M.N.Total are empty since we will use a python script to generate values since this is part of the sensitive information that is not
    being used because of privacy policies, there are even columns that are not being used for the same reason but in my main file they were neccesary for the analysis
